> For infinite loops. It is recommended to use while loops for infinite loops as for loops will throw an exeption.

## for loops
for loops have an increments and will run until the increments runs out
```cs
for (var i = 0; i < 3; i++)
{
	// Code here will run 3 times
	Console.WriteLine(i);
}
// >>> 0, 1, 2
```

<br>

## foreach loop
this loops runs thru enumerable objects and iteratables.
```cs
foreach (var item in items)
{

}
```

<br>

## while loop
this loop will run as long as the codition remainds true. If the condition is false. the loop will not execute

```cs
var condition = true;
while (condition)
{
	// execute this block of code repetively.
}
```

<br>

## do while loop
Like while loop. This do while loops will run at least once regardless of whether or not the condition is true or false.
```cs
var condition;
do
{
	// This block of code will execute at least once.
	// Will run repetively if condition is true
} while (condition)
```

## break and continue
break and continues are used in loops to interrupt the loop. Often times from within if else statements. 

### **break**
break statement immediately interrupts the flow and terminates the loop.

The bottom example shows how we would use *break* to break out of the infinite while loop when the user prompts. 
```cs
var numbers = new List<int>();
while (true)
{
	Console.WriteLine("Enter a number");
	var user_input = Console.ReadLine();
	//For simplicity sake. Null and invalid exeption handling are not implemented.
	if (user_input == "ok")
	{
		break;
	}
	else
	{
		numbers.Add(Convert.ToInt32(user_input));
	}
}
```


### **continue**
continue interrupts the flow and skips to the subsequent literation.
```cs
for (var i = 0; i <10; i++)
{
	if (i % 2 == 0)
	{
		Console.WriteLine("{0} is an even number", i);
		continue;
	}
	// This line doesnt execute if the contine statement executes
	Console.WriteLine("An odd number!")
}
```
